# YouRater (Offline)

YouRater, a Chrome extension I developed during my summer internship, enhances the video reviewing experience on YouTube by providing more in-depth options. Unlike YouTube, which offers only a simple like and dislike button, YouRater introduces a five-star rating system. This feature allows users to rate videos on a scale from one to five stars and also view each video's average star rating and the total number of star ratings received.

## Features

- **Five-Star Rating:** Easily rate YouTube videos with a five-star system.
- **Average Rating:** See the average rating of any video.
- **Rating Counts:** Find out how many users have rated a video.

## Client Code

The client code for YouRater can be viewed in the "client" folder.

## Server Code

The server-side code for YouRater is available within the repository. The latest server code is located in the "server" folder, while the previous versions can be found in the "oldserver" folder.
